# RandomicFractal

The fractal works by creating a polygon, it choses as starting point the center of the screen and than takes the middle point from the current point and
one of the vertexes of the polygon, chosen randomly, then uses that middle point as current point and iterates.

It shows that even with that random choice we can end up with a fractal-like shape.

It is evident when using 3 as number of vertexes.
